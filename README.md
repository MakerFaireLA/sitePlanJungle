The code included here comes from 
https://github.com/lmccart/itp-creative-js/tree/master/Spring-2014/week6/04_socket_server

and was found by following the tutorial at 
https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/p5.js,-node.js,-socket.io

which I discovered as one of the tutorials available on the p5.js page
https://p5js.org/tutorials/

p5.js is a javascript port of the Processing Language and may be a good platform for 
developing the drag-and-drop GUI front end for this project.

The socket.io layer described in the tutorial allows us to sync data back and forth between
the front and back ends.  We'll use Node in the standard full stack manner and MongoDB for 
the database in the backend.
