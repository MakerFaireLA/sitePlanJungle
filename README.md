## Site Planning Software for Sticky Situations

Cloud-based collaborative 2D site planning web app being developed for use by the sponsors of the upcoming 
[__San Fernando Valley Mini Maker Faire__](https://www.makerfaire.la/) on Oct 7th, 2017.  The minimalistic 
UI allows users to manipulate, relate and annotate tiles intended to represent tents, booths, port-a-poties 
and the like.  

The client-server architecture knit together with socket.io networking insures real-time synchronization both 
among different users, and between the users and the MongoDB database backend.  Both client and server are 
implemented in Javascript.  The UI is implemented in RaphaÃ«l.js, although I am considering switching 
over to something more modern like snap.js.

While the code is *very* pre-release at the moment, it is publicly available under the lGPLv3, so if you are
so inclined, have a go.  Feel free to contact me if you have questions or suggestions.  I am the sole 
developer at the moment, but I'm not at all set on keeping it that way.
