# sitePlanJungle

Cloud-based collaborative 2D site planning web app being developed for use by the sponsors of the upcoming 
*San Fernando Valley Mini Maker Faire* on Oct 7th, 2017.  The minimalistic UI allows users to manipulate, 
relate and annotate tiles intended to represent tents, booths, port-a-poties and the like.  

The client-server architecture knit together with socket.io networking insures real-time synchronization both 
among different users, and between the users and the MongoDB database backend.  Both client and server are 
implemented in Javascript.
